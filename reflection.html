            <p class="description"><b>Science</b> is everywhere. The development of civilizations is proportionate to the <b>development</b> of science.
                We create tools to make our lives easier. Technology is often <b>misconcepted;</b> it is not just about <b>"tech stuff"</b> rather, it is everything
                that we use on a <b>day-to-day</b> basis. Science and Religion always <b>contradict</b> each other. <b>Both</b> are needed to be considered and not simply
                disregarded based on just your <b>beliefs</b>. They both make good arguments and should be studied further in order to <b>improve</b> it. <b>Innovators</b> 
                of the past were frequently <b>ridiculed</b> by the majority. However, they didn't simply give up on their <b>ideas</b>; instead, they perservered 
                and made their dreams a <b>reality</b>. <b>Never give up on your dreams!</b>
